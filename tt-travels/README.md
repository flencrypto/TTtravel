# TT's Travels

This is a minimal scaffold for the TT's Travels app described in the spec. It uses **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**. Components are organized under `src/components` and pages under `src/pages` using React Router.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy `.env` and add your API keys.
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features

This skeleton includes placeholder components for:

- Map viewer
- Explore nearby locations
- Photo journal
- Trip planner
- AI trip generator

Further implementation is required to connect APIs and add offline capabilities.
